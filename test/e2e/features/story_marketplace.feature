        Then executing "eval $(crc oc-env)" succeeds
        And login to the oc cluster succeeds

        Given execute crc setup command succeeds
        When starting CRC with default bundle and nameserver "10.75.5.25" succeeds

        And executing "echo $POD" succeeds
        And executing "oc delete pod $POD --now" succeeds
        Then stdout should match "^pod(.*)deleted$"
        # after a while 1 pods should be up & running again
