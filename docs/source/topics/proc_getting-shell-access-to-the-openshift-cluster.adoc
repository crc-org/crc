.Prerequisites

* Enable OpenShift CLI ([command]`oc`) access to the cluster and log in as the `kubeadmin` user.
For detailed steps, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_gsg[Accessing the OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift CLI].

.Procedure

. Run the [command]`oc get nodes` command to identify the desired node.
The output will be similar to this:
+

crc-shdl4-master-0   Ready    master,worker   7d7h   v1.14.6+7e13ab9a7
