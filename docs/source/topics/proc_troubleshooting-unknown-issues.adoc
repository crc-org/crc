= Troubleshooting unknown issues

Resolve most issues by restarting {prod} with a clean state.
This involves stopping the instance, deleting it, reverting changes made by the [command]`{bin} setup` command, reapplying those changes, and restarting the instance.

.Prerequisites

* You set up the host machine with the [command]`{bin} setup` command.
For more information, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#setting-up-codeready-containers_gsg[Setting up {prod}].
* You started {prod} with the [command]`{bin} start` command.
For more information, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#starting-the-instance_gsg[Starting the instance].
* You are using the latest {prod} release.
Using a version earlier than {prod} 1.2.0 may result in errors related to expired x509 certificates.
For more information, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#troubleshooting-expired-certificates_gsg[Troubleshooting expired certificates].

.Procedure

To troubleshoot {prod}, perform the following steps:

. Stop the {prod} instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} stop
----

. Delete the {prod} instance:
+
include::snip_crc-delete.adoc[]

. Clean up remaining changes from the [command]`{bin} setup` command:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} cleanup
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The [command]`{bin} cleanup` command removes an existing {prod} instance and reverts changes to DNS entries created by the [command]`{bin} setup` command.
On {mac}, the [command]`{bin} cleanup` command also removes the system tray.
====

. Set up your host machine to reapply the changes:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} setup
----

. Start the {prod} instance:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The cluster takes a minimum of four minutes to start the necessary containers and Operators before serving a request.
