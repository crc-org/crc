= Setting up {prod}

The [command]`{bin} setup` command performs operations to set up the environment of your host machine for the {prod} virtual machine.

This procedure will create the [filename]`~/.crc` directory if it does not already exist.

.Prerequisites

* On Linux or {mac}, ensure that your user account has permission to use the [command]`sudo` command.
On {msw}, ensure that your user account can elevate to Administrator privileges.

[NOTE]
====
* Do not run the [command]`{bin}` binary as `root` (or Administrator).
Always run the [command]`{bin}` binary with your user account.
* If you are setting up a new version, capture any changes made to the virtual machine before setting up a new {prod} release.
