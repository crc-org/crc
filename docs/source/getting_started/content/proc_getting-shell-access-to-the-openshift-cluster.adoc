= Getting shell access to the OpenShift cluster

Direct access to the OpenShift cluster is not needed for regular use and is strongly discouraged.
If direct access to the cluster is needed for troubleshooting or debugging purposes, follow this procedure.

.Prerequisites

* [command]`oc` access to the cluster is enabled and you are logged in as the `kubeadmin` user.
For detailed steps, see <<accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_{context}>>.

.Procedure

. Run [command]`oc get nodes`. The output will be similar to this:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes",options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
crc-shdl4-master-0   Ready    master,worker   7d7h   v1.14.6+7e13ab9a7
----

. Run [command]`oc debug nodes/_<node>_` where `_<node>_` is the name of the node which was printed in the previous step.
