.Prerequisites
* Enable {openshift} CLI ([command]`oc`) access to the cluster and log in as the `kubeadmin` user.
For detailed steps, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_gsg[Accessing the {openshift} cluster with the {openshift} CLI].

.Procedure
. Run the [command]`oc get nodes` command to identify the desired node.
The output will be similar to this:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes",options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
crc-shdl4-master-0   Ready    master,worker   7d7h   v1.14.6+7e13ab9a7

. Run [command]`oc debug nodes/_<node>_` where `_<node>_` is the name of the node printed in the previous step.
