.Prerequisites
* Enable {openshift} CLI ([command]`oc`) access to the cluster and log in as the `kubeadmin` user.
For detailed steps, see link:{crc-gsg-url}#accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_gsg[Accessing the {openshift} cluster with the {openshift} CLI].

. Run the [command]`oc get nodes` command to identify the desired node.
