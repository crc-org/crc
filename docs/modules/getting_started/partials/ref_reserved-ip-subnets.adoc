= Reserved IP subnets

The {ocp} cluster managed by {prod} reserves IP subnets for internal use, which should not collide with your host network.
Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use:

.Reserved IP subnets
* `10.217.0.0/22`
* `10.217.4.0/23`
* `192.168.126.0/24`

Additionally, the host hypervisor might reserve another IP subnet depending on the host operating system.
No additional subnet is reserved on {mac} and {msw}.
The additional reserved subnet for Linux is `192.168.130.0/24`.
