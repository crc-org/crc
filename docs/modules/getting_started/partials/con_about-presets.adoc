[role="_abstract"]
{prod} presets represent a managed container runtime, and the lower bounds of system resources required by the instance to run it.
{prod} offers presets for:

include::example$snip_{project-context}_preset_list.adoc[]

On {msw} and {mac}, the {prod} guided installer prompts you for your desired preset.
On Linux, the {ocp} preset is selected by default.
You can change this selection using the [command]`{bin} config` command before running the [command]`{bin} setup` command.
You can change your selected preset from the system tray on {msw} and {mac} or from the command line on all supported operating systems.
Only one preset can be active at a time.
