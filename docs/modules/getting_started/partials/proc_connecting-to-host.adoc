= Accessing services running on your host from {prod}

When you run services on your host, you can configure {prod} to access these services.

.Prerequisites
* You have a service which is running on your host and want to consume it with {prod}.
* You are using the user mode network. On {mac} and {msw} this is the default behavior.


.Procedure
. Enable accessing services from host to {prod}:
+
----
$ crc config set host-network-access true
----

. Verify that the {prod} configuration uses user network mode and enables host network access:
+
----
$ crc config view
[...]
- network-mode                          : user
- host-network-access                   : true
[...]
----

. If {prod} instance is already running then restart it (stop => start), otherwise just start it.
+
----
$ crc stop && crc start
----

.Verification
Assuming your service is running on the host on port `8080`, to access
it from the {prod} instance, use `host.crc.testing:8080`.
