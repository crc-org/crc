= About {prod}

{rh-prod} brings a minimal {ocp} 4 cluster to your local computer.
This runtime provides minimal environments for development and testing purposes.
{prod} is mainly targeted at running on developers' desktops.
For other {ocp} use cases, such as headless or multi-developer setups, use the link:{openshift-installer-url}[full {openshift} installer].

See the link:{openshift-docs-url-landing-page}[{ocp} documentation] for a full introduction to {ocp}.

{prod} includes the [command]`{bin}` command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the {prod} instance using the desired container runtime.
