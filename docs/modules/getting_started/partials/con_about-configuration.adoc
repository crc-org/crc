= About {prod} configuration

Use the [command]`{bin} config` command to configure both the [command]`{bin}` executable and the {prod} instance.
The [command]`{bin} config` command requires a subcommand to act on the configuration.
The available subcommands are `get`, `set,` `unset`, and `view`.
The `get`, `set`, and `unset` subcommands operate on named configurable properties.
Run the [command]`{bin} config --help` command to list the available properties.

You can also use the [command]`{bin} config` command to configure the behavior of the startup checks for the [command]`{bin} start` and [command]`{bin} setup` commands.
By default, startup checks report an error and stop execution when their conditions are not met.
Set the value of a property starting with `skip-check` to `true` to skip the check.
